# Hello there üëã

My name is Adrian and I deal with JavaScript on a daily basis, mainly as part of ReactJS. While 80% of my commitment goes in this direction, I also build my own framework for WordPress - I assume that it is a very underrated CMS, as well as the PHP language itself, which has been developing amazingly in recent years.

In my work, I focus on quality and always look for the most optimal, best solutions for the end user. WordPress does not need to have 80+ plugins to be useful. In fact, the less I use the plugins, the better. I gain more control over the code, which results in easier debugging and development of the site in the future.

Besides, my interest always goes towards potentially better solutions. Until now, I have also coded in Python, Rust, Dart, as well as written automation scripts in Bash or PowerShell.

## üèó Currently I'm working on...

* My own framework to develop WordPress sites
* My personal website revamp
* My first desktop+mobile app using [Tauri](https://tauri.app)
* Some [Nova](https://nova.app) plugins (For the moment only maintaining the code)
