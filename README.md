# Hi there 👋

I'm Adrian and I'm web developer with 7+ yrs of commercial experience. I'm focusing on ReactJS and WordPress related topics. I also do web and app design.

On a daily basis I work with ReactJS, TypeScript and WordPress (in this order). I strongly prefer to work with vanilla solutions for simple reason - simplicity is beauty. There is nothing better than tailored solutions.

I also have experience working with Python, Bash, PowerShell or Vue but these are not my preferred solutions.

So far I have worked for such brands as HSBC, Twilio and Reckitt Benckiser.

## 🏗 Currently I'm working on...

* Some [Nova](https://nova.app) plugins
* My personal website revamp
* My own framework to develop WordPress sites
* My first mobile app using FLutter
